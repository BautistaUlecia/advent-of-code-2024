# My solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
### About 
Advent of code is a series of small, self-contained programming puzzles, centered around a theme and with varying difficulty levels. This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 version, written in Java 21.

### Some considerations
* Prefer readability to performance (although a balance is always welcome)
* All solutions will be my own
* Answers should be complete and agnostic to input size. I will probably not iterate for perfection, but rather strive for completion of all puzzles (depending, of course, on my available free time).
