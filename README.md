# My solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in Java
### About 
Advent of code is a series of small, self-contained programming puzzles, centered around a theme and with varying difficulty levels. This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 version, written in Java 21.

Personally I find these puzzles to be a fun way to practice problem-solving and occasionally learn features about the language I solve them on. Later entries usually require more complex solutions involving advanced data structures, multithreading, graph theory, etc. 

### Some considerations
* All solutions will be my own. I won't use LLMs and aim to only google what I genuinely don't know.
* Answers should be complete and agnostic to input size. I will probably not iterate for perfection, but rather strive for completion of all puzzles (depending, of course, on my available free time).
* I will attempt to leverage modern Java's features (such as streams, records, etc) but will not shy away from using more traditional approaches for simplicity's sake.

### About me?
I'm a software developer working mostly with Java + Spring in applications that handle massive amounts of events and process data relating to them. While I have a decent amount of experience with the language, It's generally in the context of web applications, scalability and design patterns, so I'm excited to see how I fare in a more algorithmic context.
